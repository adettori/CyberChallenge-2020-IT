CIA (Certainly Invented Agency) agents use an advanced Time-based One-Time Password algorithm that generates two super-random numbers each second.

These number pairs can be used for logging in into their mainframe.
Such a system is filled with precious secrets and even a flag for this competition!

This challenge is remote only. You will not have access to the program code or its secrets. Will you crack the secret codes anyway?

You can access to the service with:

`nc accesscode.jeopardy.cyberchallenge.it 4022`
