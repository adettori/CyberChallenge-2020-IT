When you feel tired of pwning, there is nothing like a good movie to relax and restore your abilities.

If you are undecided about what to watch, then the HMDb, the Hacker Movie Database, is the place for you.
Here you can list all hacker movies, both good and bad. The choice is yours.

A flag is in the usual place (flag.txt), but, being a place built by hackers for hackers, we have a policy that explicitly forbids to edit with nano ;-) and spawn shells. We mean it: no spawning whatsoever, we enforce this policy.

Pop corns, not shells!
