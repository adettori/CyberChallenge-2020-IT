While there are many examples of "random" password generators available on the Internet, generating strong and memorable passwords is tough. For this reason, we have developed an innovative, patent-pending algorithm that can transform any password into a strong one.
So, without further ado, connect to our password generator service and obtain strong and memorable passwords right away!

(Of course, this is a tongue-in-cheek description; do not use real passwords
or use this service for real!)
