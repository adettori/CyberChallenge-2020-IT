The device labeled as AUTH_98X276YC, produced by WeSuck Microelectronics Inc., works as a hardware authenticator. It should be a trusted component, but  unfortunately someone discovered that a hardware trojan is inside.
Are you able to find where is the trojan and what it does, what are the 
signals activating it, and what is the sequence that must be provided for each of those signals?

The flag must be submitted in the form:

`CCIT{<name_of_signal>_<activation_bit_sequence>_...}`

repeated for every signal activating the trojan. 
Please put the signals in an alphabetic order.
